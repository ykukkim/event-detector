# event-detector
This software annotates .c3d gait trajectories with Heel-Strike and Foot-Off events. It uses neural networks (more precisely Long Short Term Memory networks) through keras and tensorflow packages.

# Requirements
You only need python and btk (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/btk), all other dependencies will be installed automatically.

# Linux, Mac OS
Good news! Linux and Mac OS come with python distributions ready to use. You can go to the Installation step

# Windows
You need to install python, for example from here https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

# Instalation
Once python is installed, open terminal/command prompt and type

# pip install eventdetector
This will install eventdetector scripts with all required dependencies

# Running
Navigate Terminal or Command Prompt to a directory with .c3d files you wish to annotate with Heel-Strike and Foot-Off events. Then type

# event-detector [file-in.c3d] [file-out.c3d]
where [file-in.c3d] is the name of the file to annotate and [file-out.c3d] is the name of the new file in which you want to store annotation.

Enjoy!
